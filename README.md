# ffx_GTFS
Analysis of Ffx. Connector Service using GTFS
I split the analysis into 3 parts for ease of processing. The relevant files for this begin with the prefix 'ffx GTFS'.
The rest of the files are just the data files used to import into the Jupyter Notebooks.
There are interactive maps that I have not uploaded to github yet, so if you see some sections of code with no output, that is the reason why.
